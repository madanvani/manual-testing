second class:=

SDLC is divided into 6 phases for developing any software, we have to choose one of the process for successfully delivering quality product to the customer. 
The phases as follows:

➤ Requirements

➤ Analysis

➤ Design

➤ Coding

➤ Testing

➤ Delivery and Maintenance

Participant: Business Analyst, PM, Test Lead, Development Lead

REQUIREMENT:=

Process: Based on the appointment date given by the client along with project masager, development lead, technical lead( all are optional) along with business analyst will go to the client location and gather all the requirements of a customer.

                    After gathering the requirements from the client, they will come back to the company and they will start documenting the requirements which is easily

understandable to all the teams. After that business analyst will share documented requirements to the customer, he will verify all his requirements are covered or documented and he will update to the business analyst if at all any requirements need to updating documented requirements.

Once business analyst will get the approval from the client then he will give sign off to the requirement document.

Output:=

SRS Software requirement specification

BRS-Business requirement specification

FRS-Functional requirement specification

BD-Business document

BDD-Business design document
 
ANALYSIS PHASE:=

1. Feasibility Study

2. Selection of Technology and Environment

3. Requirement Analysis

4. Team Building

5. Understanding Document

6. Planning

Feasibility Study:

As per the budget and time provided by the bidding teams here we are going to cross verify whether we are able to complete entire project by above budget and time.

If there discussion demands any changes in the budget or time with the help of business analyst they will take it to the customer.

Selection of technology and environment:

Project manager will discuss with the architects of development lead for selecting the which technology is suitable for our project along with the environment based on the type of project.

Requirement Analysis:=

project manager, development lead, test lead are going to discuss with the business analyst for understanding of the requirements more clearly, if at all they are having any doubts or queries they are going to ask in this session. 

Team Building:=

Based on the understanding of the requirements in the above analysis phase, they are going to find out how many number of resources are required for both development and testing.

Based on the availability of resources they may use from the bench strength or they may recruit from outside.

Understanding Document:=

For understanding all the requirements business analyst is going to provide a requirement sessions to the both development and testing teams.(nearly it will be for 7 to 10 days)

Based on the understanding they have to prepare their own understanding document which is going to use for giving reverse knowledge transfer presentation to the client.

Planning:=

With the help of development lead and testing lead, project manager is going to prepare plan and he will send it to the client for approval.

Participants: BA, PM, TL, Test Lead, Development Team, Test Team, Architects, DB Teams, Deployment team.

Output: Understanding Document and Project Plan

Note:= requirement query document is the document containing questions of both development and testing people and then either development or test lead are going to share this document to business analyst for update.

DESIGN PHASE:=

Participants:= Architects

Process:= Based on the understanding of the requirements architects will prepare the design documents which are going to use for developing the GUI part of the application along with understanding of the application flow.

Output:=

1. Design document:=

a) High level design document 
b) Low level design document

Note:= unified modelling language is used for creating the diagrams, flow charts with the effective manner and easily understanding to the all team members.

Participants:= development team

Process:= Developing the programming statements

Output:= Programming statements (build)

Note:= it is a part of software containing some features and deliver to the testing team for verifying the application functionality

SRN-Software/Service Release Note

TESTING PHASE:=

1. Test Plan
2. Test Development
3. Test Execution
4. Results analysis
5. Bug Tracking
6. Reporting

3rd class:=
 
 Test Plan:=

It is a document containing all the project activities under testing. This document will tell us when and what need to do by the testing team.

Based on this document we are going to start activities accordingly.

Test Scenarios:=

Usecases: Usecases are having diagram representation of actors, actions involved as per the requirements(Architechs will prepare these diagrams).

Scenarios:=

These are high level verification points or high level ways of testing the entire application.

We need to derive test scenarios from requirements document and knowledge of all the requirements.
 
Test Cases:=

These are low level verification points which we need to derive from test scenarios.

There is no mandatory need to derive few test cases. We can derive any number of test cases based on the requirements.

Test cases having unique id, test steps, description, expected results, actual results, comment section which will allow us to easily understand what we need to verify in our application.

Test Case Execution:=

Here we are going to validate all the low level verification points and going to justify what is the quality of part or entire application.

Based on this if at all any test cases not meeting expected result then we have to update issue to the development team.

Once development team fix above raised issues, then they will update to the testing team so that we need to test again same feature whether it is working according to the requirements or not.

Status Reports:=

Based on the above test case execution, we need to update to the client through daily status reports for the update daily activities and weekly status reports for the update of week activities.

Based on these reports client will understand what is the stability of the part or entire application.

100% Quality Software:=

Based on the test case execution and if we have done with all the test cases and there is no more number of defects opened then we can deliver 100% quality software to the client and if we are able to do all these activities as per the test plan then we can say we are giving quality software to the client in on time and on budget.

Delivery and Maintenance Phase:=

Delivery:=

Whenever testing phase is completed, it means all the test cases need to execute by the testing team and there are no open defects with the development team then we are going to deliver quality software to the client.

Based on the client, with the help of his own team going to deploy it in real time environment so that it can be used by the end users.
